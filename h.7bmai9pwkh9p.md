Unless specified otherwise, these are pulled from the team’s maxpreps page, and beyond that do not represent “official” colors/style guides. Still should be more than good enough for 90% of projects.

If a color is labeled with “(TFL)” it indicates that the color was taken from the logo and manually found that way, and should not be taken as an exact brand-recognized color (as things like image noise, etc. can interfere). However, it should be more than close enough for most things.

Colors all in HEX format.

Logos

All logos can be found on the server, under the Logos folder

End card
--------

To add an end card

*   Open the server
*   Go to logos
*   Go to PLV Media Logo
*   Go to EndCard

To use the premade PLV Media outro (which I would strongly suggest) use endcardvideo7.mp4.  Use ENDCARD\_7.png for just the image.

If you used the image feel free to just put that into your project and then join back at the next step.

If you used the video, put that into your project with the video layer one above our layer you want it to fade from and it will do it automatically.

Important is that you do not adjust the length of the end still frame (or if you do adjust it in youtube as well)  

REJOIN

Upload it to YouTube. Then, in video elements click add under add an endscreen. Then in the upper right click import from video.  Search USETHIS (endcard).  Click it.  Double check that all three elements are set to be 10 seconds.  Take the lower right dot of the blue box and drag it as far as it will go.  Then hit save.  Then continue and publish your video and you are done.

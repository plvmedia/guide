Cameras
=======

Cameras do not all use the same batteries. Each camera and battery is color coded. Its power cable is also color coded. Some items are interchangeable and will have multiple colors on them.

\[TODO:\]

*   Photos and descriptors of each camera and battery and charger—call out how that camera is visually different (XA25 record button is red, body is wider; batteries are clearly marked)

#### Formatting media

*   the Vixia calls formatting initializing - different words for the same thing. ALWAYS choose COMPLETE INITIALIZATION. It will help to protect your SD card from failure.
*   the XA10 calls formatting initializing - different words for the same thing. ALWAYS choose COMPLETE INITIALIZATION. It will help to protect your SD card from failure.

### Common Issues

#### My SDI isn’t outputting! My Display won’t show anything!

This is almost always a problem with the output settings. You can change them by doing:

*   Main Menu -> A/V Set \-> Video Set \-> HDMI/SDI Out \-> HDMI+SDI

All menu buttons are on the left side of the screen.

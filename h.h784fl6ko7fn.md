Converting Guide to Website
===========================

This section is primarily for Hoch alone, as an easily-referenceable checklist.

*   Go to a private browser in chrome, and open the google doc version of the manual.
*   In google docs, go File -> Download -> Web Page (.html, zipped)
*   Open [ethanharv.github.io/GDToJekyll](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ethanharv.github.io/GDToJekyll&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647892566807278&usg=AOvVaw3LVj_1xOFj2uaeMkTT3rGZ)
*   Do NOT unzip the file, just upload it directly as a zip and click “Process”
*   Go to the PLV Media Guide folder (in documents), and delete everything EXCEPT \_config.yml and CNAME
*   Once the processed file is downloaded, put its unzipped contents into the folder.
*   Open github desktop. Commit the changes to main.
*   Remember to also click “publish.”
